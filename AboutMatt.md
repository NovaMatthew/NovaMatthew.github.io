Hi my name is Matt, I'm a second year Software Engineering student at Quinnipiac University I'm also pursing a minor in Applied Statistics and Data Science. I got into this career field because I'm innovative, I like to think creativly and I love problem solving. Outside of school I enjoy working at Over The Top Athlete Performance Center where I work part-time as a Fitness Trainer leading large group classes and mentoring dedicated athletes.
